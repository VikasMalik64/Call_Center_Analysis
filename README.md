# üß†üí° Key Insights

**Topic Distribution:**
- ‚û°Ô∏è Streaming related issues seem to be most common topic followed by Payment related and Technical support.

**Resolution Rate:**
- ‚û°Ô∏è Contract-related queries, Technical Support and Payment-related calls shows a high resolution rate.

**Speed of Answer:**
- ‚û°Ô∏è Admin Support and Contract-related calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

**Agent Performance:**
- ‚û°Ô∏è Top-performing agents like Martha, Diane could be identified for recognition or additional training, while areas for improvement could be highlighted for others.

**Trend Analysis:**
- ‚û°Ô∏è 11, 13, 17 were peak hours of the day, when call volumes were higher as compared to other times of the day.
